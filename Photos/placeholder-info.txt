PLACEHOLDER IMAGES NEEDED:

For the Recent Events section to display properly, please add these image files to the photos/ folder:

1. workshop-event.jpg (400x250px recommended)
2. tech-conference.jpg (400x250px recommended)  
3. design-competition.jpg (400x250px recommended)

If these local images are not available, the website will automatically fallback to Unsplash images from the internet.

TROUBLESHOOTING IMAGE LOADING ISSUES:

1. Internet Connection:
   - Ensure you have an active internet connection
   - Unsplash images require internet access

2. Browser Security:
   - Some browsers block external images when viewing local HTML files
   - Try opening the file through a local server instead of directly

3. Local Server Setup:
   - Use Live Server extension in VS Code
   - Or use Python: python -m http.server 8000
   - Or use Node.js: npx serve .

4. CORS Issues:
   - External images may be blocked due to CORS policy
   - Local server setup resolves this issue

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
Use a local development server (Live Server, Python, or Node.js) instead of opening HTML files directly in the browser.
